# Get Reddit thread

Automatically get Reddit thread on reddit.com. Fetch a Reddit thread by its id or URL: the post (title, text, author, score, upvote ratio, comment count, type, link) and its comments in thread order, each with author, text, score, date, permalink and nesting depth. Needs a browser signed in to Reddit. By default it returns the first page of comments Reddit shows when the thread opens; set all_comments to expand every "more replies" and get the whole tree. num_comments counts deleted and removed comments too, so the list can be shorter than that number even when it is complete. sort picks Reddit's own comment order (best, top, new, controversial, old, Q&A).

## Run it

Ask an AI agent connected to Reduck over MCP (`https://mcp.reduck.ai/mcp`) to run `reduck/reddit.com/get_thread`, or run it from a terminal:

```bash
npx @reduck-ai/cli@latest run --script reduck/reddit.com/get_thread
```

## Input

- `id` (string, optional): Post base36 id from the permalink (e.g. "1ldvy4n"), the part after /comments/.
- `url` (string, optional): Thread URL (full https://www.reddit.com/r/.../comments/... or the /r/.../comments/... path).
- `sort` (string, optional): Comment sort via Reddit's ?sort= ("confidence" = Best). Default: Reddit's Best.
- `urls` (array, optional): Not supported since 19 Oct 2026: the run fails with a message saying so. Send one id or url per call and fan out with run_script's scripts.
- `all_comments` (boolean, optional): Expand every "more replies" loader for the full tree (slower on big threads). Default: only comments rendered on load.

## Output

- `id` (string, optional): Reddit fullname, e.g. t3_1ldvy4n
- `score` (number | null, optional): Null while Reddit hides the post's score.
- `title` (string, optional)
- `author` (string, optional)
- `domain` (string | null, optional)
- `created` (string, optional)
- `op_text` (string, optional)
- `comments` (array, optional)
- `complete` (boolean, optional): True when every comment of the thread is in comments: no 'more replies' loader was left unexpanded. Pass all_comments to expand them.
- `permalink` (string, optional)
- `post_type` (string, optional)
- `subreddit` (string, optional)
- `content_href` (string | null, optional): Submission target: external link for link posts, the thread url for self posts
- `num_comments` (number, optional): Reddit's total comment count; compare with comments.length to detect on-load truncation
- `upvote_ratio` (number | null, optional)
