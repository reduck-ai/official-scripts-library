# Place Amazon order from checkout

Place the order on an open Amazon.com checkout and get its order number(s), to track the order or cancel it. It places the checkout open in the current session as it stands (address, payment, delivery options), so run it in the same session after Buy Amazon product now or Check out Amazon cart stopped at checkout. Returns the order number(s) from Your Orders, the order total that was shown, and whether the card issuer asked for a payment verification (for example in the bank app). This spends money.

```

## Input

It takes no input.

## Output

- `order_ids` (array, required): Order numbers created by this purchase (one checkout can split into several orders), as shown in Your Orders. Pass one to Cancel Amazon order.
- `confirmation_url` (string, required)
- `payment_verification_required` (boolean, required): True when the card issuer asked the cardholder to verify the payment (for example in their bank app) instead of showing the confirmation page. The order exists but waits for that approval.
- `order_total` (string | null, optional): Order total shown on the checkout page when the order was placed.
- `purchase_id` (string | null, optional): Amazon's id for the checkout itself; not an order number.
