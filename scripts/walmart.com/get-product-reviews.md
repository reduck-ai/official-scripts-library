```

## Input

- `itemId` (string, required): Walmart item id (us_item_id), the trailing number of an /ip/ URL; also returned by search-products.
- `page` (integer, optional): Review page, 10 reviews each. One page per call; the caller loops. Beyond the last page Walmart returns an empty list. With a submission-* sort the set shifts as new reviews arrive; relevancy and helpful are stable under replay.
