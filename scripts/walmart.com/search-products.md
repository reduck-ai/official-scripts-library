# Search Walmart products

Automatically search Walmart products on walmart.com. Search Walmart.com by free-text query and return one page of results. Returns query, page, sort, url, total_count, max_page, corrected_query, items and related_items (each item: us_item_id, name, url, price, was_price, unit_price, rating, review_count, image_url, seller_name, availability, badges, sponsored). Items holds the query's actual matches; when a query matches little or nothing Walmart fills the page with an "other options to consider" block, and those products are returned separately as related_items so they are never mistaken for results — a query that matches nothing comes back with empty items and a populated related_items. Sort by best_match, price_low, price_high, best_seller, rating_high or new. Prices and availability follow the store Walmart assigns to the browser's location. Walmart's bot wall is keyed on the IP and triggered by bursts of navigations, so pace fan-outs.

## Run it

Ask an AI agent connected to Reduck over MCP (`https://mcp.reduck.ai/mcp`) to run `reduck/walmart.com/search-products`, or run it from a terminal:

```bash
npx @reduck-ai/cli@latest run --script reduck/walmart.com/search-products
```

## Input

- `query` (string, required): Free-text search query.
- `page` (integer, optional): Result page (1-based). Walmart caps pagination around 15-25 pages; max_page in the result says where. Same page re-fetched returns the same organic order; sponsored tiles rotate.
- `sort` (string, optional): Walmart's own sort options.

## Output

- `url` (string, required)
- `page` (integer, required)
- `sort` (string, required)
- `items` (array, required): The query's actual matches, and only those. Walmart pads a page that matches little or nothing with an 'Other options to consider' block; those products are kept out of here and returned in related_items, so the length of this array tracks total_count instead of the tile count on screen. An empty array means the query matched nothing, which is a real answer rather than a failure.
- `query` (string, required)
- `max_page` (integer | null, required): Last page Walmart will serve for this query.
- `total_count` (integer | null, required): Walmart's own count of real matches for the query. It tracks items, not the number of tiles rendered: a page can show dozens of products while this is 0.
- `related_count` (integer, required): How many suggestions are in related_items. A high number next to a low total_count means Walmart mostly padded the page.
- `related_items` (array, required): Products Walmart suggests under 'Other options to consider' when the query matches little or nothing. Same shape as items. These are NOT results for the query and must not be treated as matches: for a query matching nothing they are the entire page. Empty for a query with plenty of matches.
- `corrected_query` (string | null, required): Query Walmart actually searched when it auto-corrected the spelling; null otherwise.
