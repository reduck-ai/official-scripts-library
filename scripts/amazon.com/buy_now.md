# Buy Amazon product now

Buy an Amazon.com product by ASIN with Buy Now or Pre-order now: stop at checkout to review it first, or place the order at once. It uses the account's default delivery address and payment method, confirming the preselected address when Amazon asks for one. By default it stops on the checkout page without ordering and returns the order total, address and payment method; to review and then place that checkout, run it in a session and follow with Get Amazon checkout information and Place Amazon order. A checkout left without ordering puts the product in the cart; remove it with Remove Amazon product from cart. With place_order set to true it places the order at once and returns the order number(s), which Cancel Amazon order takes.
