# Read Discord messages

Automatically read Discord messages on discord.com. Reads the most recent messages of a Discord channel (author, timestamp, text), newest first, scrolling up to load more until the requested count. Requires being logged in. It also reads a thread or a forum post, since both are channels in their own right: pass the post's url (from discord.com/list_forum_posts) and you get its replies plus the opening post, newest first — there is no separate thread-reading script. To list the posts of a forum channel rather than its messages, use discord.com/list_forum_posts instead.
