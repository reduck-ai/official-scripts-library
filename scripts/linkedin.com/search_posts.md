# Search LinkedIn posts

Automatically search LinkedIn posts on linkedin.com. Search LinkedIn posts by keyword, newest-first or by relevance. Returns each post's permalink (a lnkd.in short link — this surface exposes no activity id, so urn is always null), author name, profile URL and headline, full text, relative age, and reaction/comment/repost counts. Accepts limit (default 10) and sortBy ("relevance" | "date_posted").

## Run it

Ask an AI agent connected to Reduck over MCP (`https://mcp.reduck.ai/mcp`) to run `reduck/linkedin.com/search_posts`, or run it from a terminal:

```bash
npx @reduck-ai/cli@latest run --script reduck/linkedin.com/search_posts
```

## Input

- `limit` (integer, optional): Maximum posts to return (default 10). Results are scrolled until this many cards have loaded; fewer come back when the query has fewer posts.
- `sortBy` (string, optional): Result ordering. Anything other than "date_posted" falls back to relevance.
- `keyword` (string, optional): Search terms, as typed into LinkedIn's content search. "keywords" is accepted as an alias for this field (it is what LinkedIn's own URL calls it).
- `keywords` (string, optional): Alias for "keyword" — same meaning; pass either one.

## Output

- `posts` (array, required)
- `start` (number, optional)
- `total` (number | null, optional)
