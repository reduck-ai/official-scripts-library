# Reply to a Discord message

Automatically reply to a Discord message on discord.com. Reply to a specific Discord message, addressed by its own url. Unlike discord.com/post_message, this creates a proper reply — visible as a reference to the original message rather than a plain new post in the channel. Returns the new message's id, channel id, timestamp and content, plus the id of the message it replied to.
